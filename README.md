# CSGMNet: A Cross-scale and Global Mamba Network for Farmland Parcel Segmentation

## üå± Introduction
We propose CSGMNet, an improved framework built on HBGNet, which introduces two novel modules:

1. **CFIM (Cross-scale Feature Integration Module)**  
   Adaptively fuses multi-scale features for consistent cross-scale representation.  

2. **GMCM (Global-aware Mamba Convolution Module)**  
   Combines convolutional detail extraction with Mamba state-space modeling for efficient global‚Äìlocal feature fusion.

## Data Preprocessing
1.We crop the original images and their corresponding annotations into 256√ó256 patches to standardize the input size for training.

2.Patches with less than 30% parcel coverage are discarded to reduce class imbalance, and the remaining data are split into 5,499 training samples, 1,376 validation samples, and 1,208 testing samples to ensure a balanced dataset for model development and evaluation.

3.We apply multiple data augmentation techniques, including flipping, mirroring, Gaussian noise, contrast adjustment, scaling, and mix-up, to enhance sample diversity and improve model generalization..


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liye1213/CSGMNET.git
cd CSGMNET
```
## üöÄ Usage
Run the following example to test the model:

```python
import torch
from CSGMNet import Field

model = Field()
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

outputs = model(x)
mask, edge, distance = outputs
```
